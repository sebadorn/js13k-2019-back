# How to send back…

Entry for the [js13k competition of 2019](https://2019.js13kgames.com/entries/how-to-send-back).  
Theme: **Back**


## Description

The new season of "How to send back…" airs! The first show was not well received, maybe it was too boring. So the producers thought of something new.

As alternative for the [W] and [A] button prompts, the up and left arrow keys can be used too.

[Esc] – Pause.
